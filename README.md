# DES
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher algorithm developed in the 1970s. Operating on 64-bit blocks with a 56-bit key, DES was widely used, but its security was compromised due to the key length. It has been replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), yet remains studied and used in non-critical contexts.
